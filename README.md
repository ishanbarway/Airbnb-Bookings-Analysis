## Case
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as :
* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

## ABSTRACT

The project uses Python and its external data processing packages to conduct an in-depth analysis of Airbnb Booking NYC 2019 review data. Airbnb is an online marketplace for renting out homes/villas/ private rooms. The website charges a commission (3 to 20 percent) for every booking. We were provided with NYC 2019 csv file with classified labels in our data set.
The project can help to understand that what could be the reason for the classification of such labels by feature selection, data analysis with Python and Matplotlib for data visualization taking into account to determine the correct documentation.

## Conclusion
With the help of above performed Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization in Airbnb Dataset, suggest us about several insights. EDA help us to detect obvious errors, identify outliners in datasets.

We use EDA to ensure the results produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. Data cleaning concept of missing values if not handled properly then inaccurate interference occurs in the data. It can lead to wrong prediction and classification.

* Manhattan is the most expensive Neighbourhood, with less land area but has highest number of Hotels as well as highest customer count.
* Staten Island has larger land area then Manhatten But still has less hotels and customer count.
* Most of the people prefer Entire home/apt or private rooms, very few prefer shared rooms.
* Brooklyn and Manhattan has the most hotels with high review count but Hillside Hotel, Queens has the highest review count in all
